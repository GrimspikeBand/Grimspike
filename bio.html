      <h1>Grimspike – Music That Cuts Like a Blade</h1>
      <p>Grimspike is not your average band. Their story begins in the raw backstreets of the American urban sprawl, where founding members RonZ and Jack NV met as teenagers. RonZ was born in Mexico to non-Latin parents and moved to the U.S. as a child — the details are hazy, and deliberately so. He grew up on the edge of society, running with street kids, learning early that if you don’t fight to be heard, you’ll be drowned out. That’s where he met Jack NV, a Mexican-American kid with a trumpet in his hands and mariachi roots in his blood — though his soul leaned heavy into distortion and rebellion. At 18, they formed Grimspike, driven by a desire to build something louder, dirtier, and more honest than anything around them. Music that punches, provokes, and never apologizes.</p>
      <p>It didn’t take long before they realized the band needed a bold, fearless voice up front — someone who could match their energy and push it even further. Enter Jessica Grown. A vocalist whose haunting past is mostly off-limits, Jessica was abandoned at a church when she was just two or three years old — “like a bag of trash,” she says. What followed was a chaotic shuffle through foster homes and institutions. But with help from what she only calls “some good people,” Jessica found a way forward. She studied music — and found her voice, one you can’t ignore.</p>
      <p>Jessica didn’t just join the band — she became its spine. With her raw charisma, versatile vocals, and razor-sharp lyrics, she quickly stood out as more than just a frontwoman. She’s the storm. The mouthpiece. The fire.</p>
      <p>Grimspike gained a name in the underground scene for their brutally honest lyrics and no-holds-barred attitude. Their songs call out everyone and everything, with a grin and a fist in the air. Sonically, they fuse hardcore and gangster rap with heavy guitar riffs, Latin-infused trumpet lines, violins, synths, and a sense of melody that cuts through the noise. They don’t blend in — they stand out. Loudly.</p>
      <p>This isn’t just a band. It’s survival. A scream in the silence. A raised middle finger to the world.</p>

          <h3>🎤 Jessica Grown – Vocals, Guitar, Bass Guitar, Piano, Keyboards</h3>
          <p>Jessica’s voice cuts like a blade, but her story cuts even deeper. Abandoned as a toddler at a church door, she bounced through foster homes and institutions. The streets taught her self-defense early, sharpening her reflexes and forging her physique. A multi-instrumentalist, Jessica’s talents on guitar, bass, piano, and keyboards form the band’s backbone. With sharp lyrics, haunting tone, and a stage presence you can’t ignore, she’s the storm, the mouthpiece, and the fire.</p>

          <h3>🎧 RonZ – Producer, Rap Vocals, Guitar, Bass Guitar</h3>
          <p>Born in Mexico to mysterious roots, RonZ grew up in America’s gritty urban sprawl. On the streets, physical strength was non-negotiable, so he built his body accordingly. He’s the architect of chaos — producing, mixing, and rapping with raw power. A versatile musician, RonZ also plays guitar and bass guitar, adding heavy riffs and rhythmic backbone to Grimspike’s sound.</p>

          <h3>🎺 Jack NV – Trumpet, Beats, and Wind Instruments</h3>
          <p>Jack NV bridges past and present. Raised on mariachi but baptized in punk, he fuses genre in every note. His trumpet howls like a siren, his beats hit like a riot, and he commands almost any wind instrument. He’s the misfit heartbeat of Grimspike — loud, proud, and impossible to miss.</p>
