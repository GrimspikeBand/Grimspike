      <h1>Grimspike – Music That Cuts Like a Blade</h1>
      <p>Grimspike is not your average band. Their story begins in the raw backstreets of the American urban sprawl, where founding members RonZ and Jack NV met as teenagers. RonZ was born in Mexico to non-Latin parents and moved to the U.S. as a child — the details are hazy, and deliberately so. He grew up on the edge of society, running with street kids, learning early that if you don’t fight to be heard, you’ll be drowned out.</p>
      <p>That’s where he met Jack NV, a Mexican-American kid with a trumpet in his hands and mariachi roots in his blood — though his soul leaned heavy into distortion and rebellion. At 18, they formed Grimspike, driven by a desire to build something louder, dirtier, and more honest than anything around them. Music that punches, provokes, and never apologizes.</p>
      <p>It didn’t take long before they realized the band needed a bold, fearless voice up front — someone who could match their energy and push it even further. Enter Jessica Grown. A vocalist whose haunting past is mostly off-limits, Jessica was abandoned at a church when she was just two or three years old — “like a bag of trash,” she says. What followed was a chaotic shuffle through foster homes and institutions. But with help from what she only calls “some good people,” Jessica found a way forward. She studied music. She found her voice — and it’s one you can’t ignore.</p>
      <p>Jessica didn’t just join the band — she became its spine. With her raw charisma, versatile vocals, and razor-sharp lyrics, she quickly stood out as more than just a frontwoman. She’s the storm. The mouthpiece. The fire.</p>
      <p>Grimspike gained a name in the underground scene for their brutally honest lyrics and no-holds-barred attitude. Their songs call out everyone and everything, with a grin and a fist in the air. Sonically, they fuse hardcore and gangster rap with heavy guitar riffs, Latin-infused trumpet lines, violins, synths, and a sense of melody that cuts through the noise. They don’t blend in — they stand out. Loudly.</p>
      <p>This isn’t just a band. It’s survival. A scream in the silence. A raised middle finger to the world.</p>

          <h3>🎤 Jessica Grown – vocals</h3>
          <p>Jessica’s voice cuts like a blade, but her story cuts even deeper. Abandoned as a toddler at a church door, she was bounced from one foster home to another. Her past is a locked vault, but her voice opens it wide. With sharp lyrics, haunting tone, and a stage presence you can’t ignore, she became the soul of Grimspike. She’s not just the frontwoman — she’s the storm, the mouthpiece, and the fire.</p>

          <h3>🎧 RonZ – producer / rap vocals</h3>
          <p>Born in Mexico to mysterious roots, RonZ was raised in the shadows of America’s concrete sprawl. He’s the architect of chaos — producing, mixing, and rapping with raw power. His body is inked like a war map, and his mind? Sharper than his blade-like beats. RonZ brings the street into every bar and the pain into every pulse.</p>

          <h3>🎺 Jack NV – trumpet / beats</h3>
          <p>Jack NV is the bridge between past and present. A second-generation Mexican-American, raised on mariachi but baptized in punk. His trumpet howls like a siren through the band’s sound, and his beats hit like a riot. He’s the misfit heartbeat of Grimspike — loud, proud, and impossible to miss.</p>
