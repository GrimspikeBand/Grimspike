      <h2>Grimspike’s Unplugged Chaos @ The Vic – Now on Spotify!</h2>

      <p>GrimSpike’s Jessica Grown, RonZ, and Jack NV lit up The Vic Theatre with an acoustic set that echoed the rawness of Nirvana’s iconic Unplugged — but with a twist only Grimspike could deliver. 🎸🔥</p>
      <p>The crowd went wild from the first chord to the final scream. It wasn’t just a concert — it was a moment. A stripped-down explosion of energy, soul, and rebellion.</p>
      <p>The acoustic set was recorded live, and select clips are already out — including this one. But that’s just the beginning.</p>
      <p>A full behind-the-scenes video is in the works, capturing everything from the chaos backstage to the roar of the audience. Until then, stream the <em>Acoustic and Alternative</em> album on Spotify and all major platforms.</p>
      <p>Don’t miss the vibes. This is Grimspike, raw and real.</p>

      <h2>“Yippee Ki-Yay, Motherf***er” – The Song That Shook the Swipe Culture</h2>
      <img src="GS 014 Catfish .jpg" alt="Yippee Ki-Yay Art" class="vlog-thumbnail">
      <p>Jessica Grown and RonZ didn’t just drop a track — they dropped a bomb on swipe culture. “Yippee Ki-Yay, Motherf***er” is a brutal takedown of online dating fakery, and it's already raising eyebrows (and blood pressure) all over the internet.</p>
      <p>With lines that hit like a punch to the digital ego, the song calls out catfishers, flexers, and filter freaks — and doesn’t spare any names. This one’s raw, dirty, and unfiltered, just like Grimspike fans love it.</p>
      <p>Some self-proclaimed influencers and dating app diehards weren’t thrilled — and rumor has it the song sparked backlash in certain "dating strategy" forums. No direct names were mentioned, but let’s just say… they know who they are. 😉</p>
      <p>The music video is still in production, but the track is already streamable — and turning up in playlists and angry blog posts alike.</p>
